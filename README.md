# minute-web-downloaders
This repository contains my personal collection of Shell scripts for batch downloading of files from filehosting websites.

They're really just little one-liners I've created and maintained for myself and a few internet friends, but I've decided to share them so anybody can study and use them.

## About the files
The scripts for each website lie in the main folder. They take a list of URLs from the standard input, one per line, and downloads each of them one by one. (I could make them download stuff in parallel, but some websites block that, plus I'm lazy)

Since one-liners can be counter-intuitive, I maintain pretty-printed copies of them with insightful comments for better comprehension of the code. These can be found in the **formatted-code** folder.
